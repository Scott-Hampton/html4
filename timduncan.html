			<h2>Background Info</h2>
			<p>Kameryn Louise "Kami" Craig was an American water polo player, playing the 2-meter/hole set position.  She is one of the most decorated water polo athletes ever, winning two Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016, and winning a silver medal in 2008, all with the US.  During her 4-year college career at USC, she won the Peter J. Cutino award twice, which is given to the top collegiate water polo player every year.  A rock-solid point defender and an absolute beast of an offensive set player, Craig's offensive prowess emitted a certain "gravity" effect on the oppostion - if the defenders positioned themselves too far away from her, Craig would have had too easy of a time taking a <b title="A pass thrown at the water directly in front of the player, allowing the receiver some time before fielding the pass" style="color: darkcyan"> wet pass</b> from one of her teammates and scoring.  This in turn created more space around the perimeter of the US women's (&#9792) National Water Polo Team's offense, allowing for more fluid ball movement and more efficient shot opportunities.</p>
