					<h2>Some Info on Kobe Bryant</h2>
					<img src="images/kobe_bryant.jpg" alt="The Lakers Legend inside of Staples Center" width="300" height="168">
					<p>Kobe Bryant was a larger than life superstar who played his entire NBA basketball career with the Los Angeles Lakers. Known for his two-way game and endless offensive arsenal (including his patented <em title="A tough shot attempt in which the shooter has to create space between the defender and themselves by moving away from the basket while in the act of shooting. Kobe made it look easy like no one else did outside of Michael Jordan." style="color: darkmagenta">fadeaway jumpshot</em>), Kobe was motivated unlike anybody to achieve success. His intensity demanded the best out of all those around him, which helped lead his teams to seven finals appearances and five championship rings.</p>

				  <h3>Comparing Leadership Styles</h3>
					<p>While it might be a bit more romanticized that Tim Duncan's more quiet and calm demeanor was the better form of leadership, Kobe's intensity and rage at players not performing up to their best was arguably equally as great of a motivator at the NBA level. A argument in favor of Kobe might point to both of the players' experiences with <i style="color:slategray">Team USA Olympic Basketball</i>. Even though the 2008 and 2012 Olympic squads that Bryant was a part of were more talented than the 2004 team Tim Duncan captained, the results speak for themselves; the '08 and '12 teams took home the gold behind the vocal leadership of Kobe, but the '04 squad finished with a highly disappointing Bronze.</p>

				  <h2>Some Info on Tim Duncan</h2>
					<img src="images/timmyd.jpg" alt="Tim Duncan in the midst of an NBA game" width="300" height="200">
					<p>Tim Duncan, along with Gregg Popovich, was the fulcrum upon which the Spurs' unprecendent 20+ year stretch of NBA success was built.  Coming out of college and ready to dominate the NBA immediately, Duncan was the defensive anchor of a consistently elite defensive squad year in and year out, while also being the Spurs' best scorer for over ten years. Duncan's willingness to supress his ego and be completely coachable set the standard for all other Spurs players to follow over two decades, netting them five championships, and netting Duncan three finals MVP awards (he was less than ten seconds away from netting his fourth of those trophies until Ray Allen did his thing...)</p>
